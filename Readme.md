Project Description: Local Language Learning Assistant

The Local Language Learning Assistant is a simple tool that helps students understand their school lessons in their own language. Many children struggle because their textbooks or homework are written in a language they find difficult. This assistant solves that problem by translating lessons into the student’s local language, reading the text aloud, and creating easy practice questions.

By making learning clearer and more accessible, this project supports low-income, rural, and underserved students who may not have access to tutors or extra help. With just a few clicks, students can study better, learn faster, and understand their lessons with confidence.
